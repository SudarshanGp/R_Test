Express middleware for refreshing/reloading routes during development. Does not rely on restarting the process like other implementations.

#### Usage:
Just require the file, and add the middleware before the express router middleware, example:

	var express-refresh = require('express-refresh');
	app.configure(function(){
		...
		app.use(express-refresh());
  		app.use(app.router);
		...
	});

It'll automatically detect whether or not you're in development mode, will not 'load' otherwise.

#### Limitations:
1) Functions in the main express file (usually 'app.js') won't get refreshed.

Therefore any route middleware / functions will not be refreshed, example:

	// this function doesn't get refreshed
	var getUser = function(req,res,next){ 
		next(); };
	//  but the actual routing still does
	app.get('/', getUser, routes.index);

- Only workarounds are requiring people to export their functions or...
- making the parser be able to properly parse that and call eval() on it...
- Or... don't write route middleware inside app.js, but put it in another file.

2) That means this also won't be refreshed... inline functions, example:

	app.get('/', function(req,res,next){ next(); }, routes.index);

And again, the actual routing does get refreshed, just not the function.
